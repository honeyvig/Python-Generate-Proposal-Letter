# Example Usage:
client_name = "Client Name"
website_examples = """
    - [Insert Link to Shift4Shop Website Example 1]
    - [Insert Link to Shift4Shop Website Example 2]
    - [Insert Link to Shift4Shop Website Example 3]
"""

proposal = generate_proposal(client_name, website_examples)
print(proposal)

How It Works:

    Client Name: The client_name variable will dynamically insert the recipient's name into the proposal.
    Website Examples: The website_examples variable is for you to list examples of previous Shift4Shop websites you've worked on, which will be included in the proposal.
    Formatting: The generate_proposal() function assembles the proposal text using Python's f-string formatting to dynamically place the client name and website examples into the proposal.

Customization:

    Client Name: You can replace the client_name variable with the specific client's name.
    Website Examples: Add your actual Shift4Shop website examples or leave them as placeholders.

Output:

When you run the code, the generated proposal will be printed, ready for you to send.
